1          TheoryOscillations   are   ubiquitous   in   nature.    The   action   of   a   heartbeat   or   ﬁring   of   a   neuron,   the   business   cycles   in   economics,   the   operation   of electrical   grids,   and   the   seismic   activity   of the   earth   are just   a   few   examples   of   systems   which   undergo   oscillation.    An   oscillation   is   the   periodic   (repetitive)   variation   of   some   quantity.   Physical   oscillation   is   commonly   referred   to   as   harmonic   motion,   a   name   originating   from   the   ﬁrst   inves-   tigations   of   musical   harmony.    Early   experiments   performed   by   Pythagoras   and   his   students   were   the   ﬁrst   to   quantify the   relationship   between   physical   motion   and   sound.   In this   lab, you will   study   the   behavior   of   a   weight   attached   to   a   spring.    Despite   the   simplicity   of the   system,   the   corresponding   analysis   extends   far   beyond   the   realm   of springs   (and   even   mechanics).
1.1          Simple   Harmonic   MotionIn   the   pendulum   motion   lab,   you   were   introduced   to   the   concept   of   a   restoring   force.    When   stationary,   the   pendulum   hangs   in   its   equilibrium   position.    If   dis-   placed   a   small   amount   to   the   left,   the   gravitational   force   acts   to   pull   the   bob   back   to   equilibrium.      A   displacement   to   the   right   does   the   same   thing.      In   this   example, the gravitational force behaves as a   restoring   force as   it   always   acts   to   restore the bob to its   equilibrium   position.    The deﬁning   characteristic   of   simple   harmonic   motion   is   that   the   force   responsible   for   motion   is   a   restoring   force   which   depends   linearly   on   the   displacement   of the   weight   from   equilibrium.      The   spring   force   happens   to   meet   both   of these   criteria   in   most   physical   situations.   
Figure   1:      Successive   snapshots   of a weight   on   a   spring   show that the position of the   weight varies sinusoidally in   time   (image   source:    Bauer       Westfall,   2014).   Figure   2:   The   position   of the   weight   at   the   min-   imum,      equilibrium,      and   maximum   positions   la-   beled   on   the   x-axis.Hooke’s   law   is   the   empirical   description   of   the   force   exerted   by   a   spring.    Consider   the   spring   shown   in   Figure 1.         The   weight   oscillates   because   the   spring   exerts   a   restoring   force   as   it   extends   and   compresses.   This   force   is   described   by   Hooke’s   law   which,   in   one   dimension,   has   the   form.	Fs      =   -kx                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    (1)where      k   is      a      number      characterizing   the      stifness   of   the      spring      called   the      spring      constant   and      x   is   the   displacement      from      equilibrium.       Figure   2      shows    three    important      positions      of   the      weight.       The    x-axis    is   oriented   vertically   and   pointed   downward.
(a)      The   spring   is   fully   compressed   with   the   weight   at   its   minimum   position,   x   =   -A.    Here,   the   weight   experiences   a   force   Fs      =   -k(-A) = kA.    This   amounts   to   a   push   towards   equilibrium.
(b)    The spring is in its   equilibrium   position   with   the   weight   at   x =   0.    According to   Equation   1,   the   spring   force   at   this   point   is   Fs      = 0.   While   the   spring   exerts   no   force   at   this   point,   the   weight’s   inertia   causes   it   to   continue   moving   through   the   equilibrium   position.
(c)    The      spring      is      fully      extended      with      the      weight      at      its      maximum      position,    x      =    A.       Here,    the    weight   experiences   a   force   Fs      =   -kA.      This   amounts   to   a   pull   towards   equilibrium.This   process   repeats   periodically,   with   the   weight   continuously   moving   between   -A   and   A.      The   number   A   is   called   the   amplitude,   which   is   a   measure   of the   distance   traveled   in   one   cycle.    The   period   is   the   time   of one   complete   cycle   and   is   typically   denoted   as   T.    The   ordinary   frequency   is   the   number   of cycles   per   second   and   is   directly   related   to   the   period   byf = T/1                                                                                                                                                                            (2)With   a   qualitative   understanding   of simple   harmonic   motion,   we   are   in   a   position   to   develop   a   quantitative   model   of   the   displacement   as   a   function   of   time,   x(t).    The   ﬁrst   step   is   to   identify   any   involved   forces   and   use   our   friend   Fnet    =   ma.    Consider   the   simplest   case   in   which   the   only   force   involved   is   the   spring   force,   Fs      =   -kx.      This   gives   the   relationshipFnet      = ma =   -kx.                                                                                                                                                                                                            (3)This      equation      can      be      used      to      determine      the      displacement      as      a      function      of   time,    but    doing      so      requires   some   footwork.    The   ﬁrst   step   is   to   recognize   that   the   acceleration   is   the   second   derivative   of the   position,   a = d2   x/dt2   .    Substituting   this   into   Equation 3   givesm dt2/d2x   =   -kx.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        (4)
Taking one ﬁnal step makes the relationship more clear, writing the previous   equation   as
                                                                                                                                                                  (5)where   x   is   written   as   x(t)   to   explicitly   show   that   the   position   is   a   function   of time.    This   is   an   ordinary   diferential   equation   with   a   form   identical   to   that   for   the   angle   θ(t)   in   the   pendulum   motion   lab.      The equation   above   says   that   x(t)   must   be   a   function   whose   second   derivative   equals   itself   times   a   negative   constant.   The   sine   and   cosine   functions   behave   in   this   way   (you   should   verify   this   for   yourself).
With most diferential equations, the best way to ﬁnd a solution is to guess and check.   We have a hunch
that   the   solution   is   sinusoidal, which   is   further   supported   by   the   red   curve   traced   in   Figure   1.   Let’s   try
x(t) =   A   cos   (ω0t)                                                                                                                                                                     (6)
where ω0    is the angular frequency.   In order to check ifour guess is valid, we can take derivatives of x(t) and   see   if   Equation   5   is   satisﬁed:
      
The   trick   is   to   compare   Equations   5   and   7, as   they   are   both   equal   to   the   second   derivative   of   the   position:
   This   shows   that   Equation   6   is   a   valid   solution,   with   the   added   bonus of ﬁnding a relationship between the angular frequency, spring   con-   stant, and   mass   (shown   in   red).    Thus, the   angular      frequency   of our oscillating mass   is
ω0      = √                                                                                                                     (9)There   is   one      problem   left   to   address.      According   to   Equation 6, the   position   at   t   =   0   is   ﬁxed:   x(0)   =   A   cos   (0)   =   A.    If   we   start measuring   when   the   weight   is   not   exactly   at   its   maximum   value,   then   x(0)    A.   This   is   illustrated   in   Figure   3, where   t   = 0 corresponds   to a value less than the maximum.   To account for   this   shift   in   position,   we   introduce   a   number   called   a   phase   constant   which   is   typically denoted   by   a   lowercase   Greek   phi,   φ   .    With   this   modiﬁcation,   we   arrive at a general solution for the position   as   a   function   of time:
x(t) = A   cos   (ω0t +   φ).                                                                                     (10)
With   this   equation,   the   position   of   the   weight   can   be   predicted   at any point in time as long   as   long   as   A, ω0   ,   and   φ   are   known.

1.2          Damped   Harmonic   MotionThe   motion   described   in the   previous   section   is   called   ”simple”   because   the   behavior   does   not   change   for   diferent masses and springs.   Regardless of   the situation, an object in simple harmonic motion will continue to oscillate indeﬁnitely.   While this is a good approximation for many systems, a more   accurate   model   must   consider   the   efects   of   dissipative   processes.   Without   an   external   energy   source, all   macroscopic   oscillations will eventually decay as stored energy   is   converted   into   heat.    This decay reduces   the   oscillation   amplitude   in   a   process   called   damping.
The efects of damping can be introduced   to   the   model   by   adding   a   damping   force   that   resists   motion.   The   damping force   can be   approximated   as   Fd       =   -bv    where   b   called the   damping   coefficient   and   v   is the

velocity   of   the   object.    Circling   back   to   Fnet         =   ma,   we   can   follow   the   same   procedure   as   in   the   previous section, where the total force on the   mass   is   now
Fnet      =   Fd   +   Fs               ma = -bv - kx   The last line gives the relationship necessary to determine the position of a damped   oscillator   as   a   function   of   time.    By   deﬁning   √    =   b/2m   and   using   the   deﬁnition   ω0(2)      =   k/m   from   above,   the   resulting   diferential equation can be expressed compactly   as   = -2√                                                                                                                                                                              (11)In   the   last   line, we   have   acknowledged   that   the   velocity   is   the   time   derivative   of   position,   v   = dx/dt.   This is   the   damped   analog   of   Equation 5   for   the   simple   harmonic   oscillator.      When   damping   is   present,   the   properties   of   the   spring, mass, and   friction   signiﬁcantly   afect   the   character   of   x(t).   Under   the   conditions   of this experiment, you will study underdamped   oscillations.   The equation for the   position   as   a   function   of   time   resembles   Equation   10, but   now   the   amplitude   is   also   a   function   of   time, giving   x(t) = A(t)   cos   (ωt +   φ). It   turns   out   that   the   amplitude   decays   exponentially   as   A(t) = A0   e-√t   where   A0   is   the   maximum   amplitude.   This   gives   the   explicit   form   of   the   position   for   a   damped   oscillator,x(t) = A0   e-√t   cos   (ωt   +   φ),                                                                                                                                                                                    (12)   which   is   the   red   curve   shown   above   in   Figure   4.   Let’s   take   a   closer   look   at   the   parameters   in   this   equation:
●   A0      is   the   maximum   amplitude.    This   value   is   reached   only   in   the   ﬁrst   oscillation,   as   all   subsequent oscillations have a decaying   amplitude.
●   √   is   the   damping   rate, deﬁned   above   as                                                                                                                                                                        (13)
where   √   is   a   lowercase   Greek   gamma.    The   damping   rate   is   directly   related   to   the   oscillation   decay   time, with   units   of   s-1   .
●   ω   is the   system    angular frequency.   This is the measurable frequency of the   oscillator.   It   is   related   to   the undamped angular speed, ω0   , and the damping   angular   speed,   √   ,   by                                                                                                                           (14)
This shows that the oscillation   frequency   is   always   reduced   when   compared   with   the   undamped   fre-   quency, with the reduction dependent upon the damping coefficient   (b) and the mass of the oscillator.

代做程序编程语言sition   of   a   underdamped   harmonic   oscillator   as   a   function   of   time,   with   the   exponential   damping   curve   shown   in   light   blue   (image   source:    Bauer       Westfall,   2014).The graph in Figure   5shows the position as a function of time with the efects of damping.    The sinusoidal   nature   is   still   evident,   but   now   the   curve   is   ”enveloped”   by   an   exponential   function   which   decays   with   time   (light   blue   curve).      The   rate   at   which   oscillations   decay   is   extremely   important   to   engineers   in   many   ﬁelds.   The   development   of car   suspension,   rocket   engines,   bridges   and   buildings,   and   audio   systems   are just   a   few   examples   which   require   careful   damping   rate   tuning.
1.3          Damping   Rate   EstimationThere   is   a   useful   method   for   estimating   the   damping   rate   for   a   decaying   oscillation   that   only   requires   a   graph   of the   position   as   a   function   of time.    Take   a   close   look   at   decaying   amplitude   of the   graph   in   Figure   5,   represented   by   A(t)   =   A0   e-吖t.    Dimensional   analysis   tells   us   that   the   damping   rate,   √   ,   must   have   units   of s-1    (the   argument   of   an   exponential   function    must   be   unitless).    It   is   common   to   deﬁne   a   corresponding   characteristic   time   constant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  (15)
where   τ   is   a   lowercase   Greek tau.   This   is   analogous to the relationship   between   the   period   and   the   ordinary   frequency,   T =   1/f.   With   this   deﬁnition,   the   amplitude   can   be   expressed   asA(t) =   A0   e-t/τ   .                                                                                                                                                                                                               (16)
This curve is shown to the right.   Consider the value of A(t) at two diferent   times:
●   At      t      =    0,    A(0)    =    A0   .         This      is      the      maximum      amplitude      in      this example.
●   At   t   =   τ   ,      A(τ   )      =   A0   e-τ   /τ         =   A0   e-1   .         Recalling   that   the   number   e ≈ 2.718,   its   inverse   is   e-1    = 0.368.    This   gives   A(τ   )   = 0.368A0   .    In other   words,   the   time   at   which   the   amplitude   is   36.8%   of its   initial   value   is   the   time   constant.

Using this process, the time constant can be used   in   conjunction with   Equation   15   to   determine the   damping   rate.   A   table   summarizing   important   quantities   related   to   oscillation   and   damping   times   is   given   below.QuantityRelationshipOrdinary   FrequencyAngular   Frequency   Damping   RateTime   Constantf   =   1/T      ω   =   2πf      √   =   b/2m    τ   =   1/√
1.4          Theory   Questions
1.   It   is   important to   recognize that the   spring   force   depends   on the   displacement   from   equilibrium.    A   more general expression for Hooke’s   law   is
Fs      = -k△xwhere   △x   = x   - x0      is   the   amount   by   which   the   spring   is   stretched.    We   typically   deﬁne   coordinates (the   measurement   system) such   that   the   equilibrium   position   is   x0      = 0 to   obtain   the   form   Fs      = -kx.   The diagram below shows three cases   of an   identical   spring   suspending   diferent   masses.   The   masses   are   stationary      with   displacements   indicated   on   the   x-axis.   The   position   x   = 0 corresponds   to   the   end of the unstretched spring.   
a.   (1 pt) A   free-body   diagram   is   a   tool   to   help   you   write   an   equation   for   Fnet.    Draw   a   free-body diagram   showing   the   forces   acting   on   an   arbitrary   mass,   m.
b.   (1 pt) Write down an equation for net force acting   on   a   mass.   With   this,   solve   for   the   acceleration,   a, in   terms   of   the   spring   constant   k, the   displacement   x, the   gravitational   acceleration   g, and   the mass.
c.   (2 pt) What is the acceleration when the mass is at rest in the equilibrium position?   Use this fact   and your result from the previous question to   obtain   an   equation   that   gives   the   displacement   in   terms   of   g   , k,   and   m.
d.   (1 pt) Use your equation to predict the displacement you would measure in a   lab   if you hung   a   1   kg   mass   from   a   spring   with   k   = 7 N/m.   Use   g   = 9.8 m/s2      as   the   gravitational   acceleration.e.   (1 pt) Sketch   a   graph   of   the   displacement   vs.   mass.   Indicate   the   three   points   (m,   x1   ),   (2m,   x2   ),   and (3m,   x3   ) corresponding to the picture above.   What can be said about the slope of   the graph?
f.   (1   pt)   How   would   the   graph   change   if the   positions   were   measured   from   the   top   of the   spring   instead   of   the   position   labeled   x    =   0?    Does   changing   the   starting   point   of the   measurement   change the slope of the graph sketched in the   previous   question?
g.   (1 pt) Does the force exerted by a spring   depend   on   the   choice   of a   coordinate   system?
2.   (1   pt)   If   a   large   weight   is   attached   to   a   small   spring,   the   spring   will   overstretch   and   deform.    The deformation   changes the behavior. of the   spring.    With this   observation,   do   you   think   Hooke’s   law   is   valid for any   displacement?
3.   (1 pt) Is gravity necessary for a mass   on   a   spring   to   oscillate?
2          Experimental   SetupIn this experiment, you will use   electronic   equipment   to   measure   the   mechanical   properties   of   a   system   com-   prised   of a   spring   and   a   set   of masses.    A   digital   oscilloscope   is   a tool that   produces   a   real-time visualization   of   an   input   voltage.    If   a   damped   oscillating   voltage   is   fed   into   an   oscilloscope,   the   device   can   generate   an   image   like   that   shown   below,   where   the   vertical   axis   is   voltage   and   the   horizontal   is   time.    This   allows   for   digital   measurements   of the   amplitude   or   period   (labeled   as   T   Figure 7).   
Figure   7
1.    (1 pt) For the oscillation   shown   in   Figure   7,   determine   the   peak   amplitude   A0      (no   units   are   necessary),   the   period   T,   the   ordinary   frequency   f,   and   the   angular   frequency   W   .
2.    (1   pt)   Does   the   signal   in   Figure 7   look   like   a   damped   or   an   undamped   oscillation?A   dynamic   force   transducer   is   an   interface   between   the   spring   (a   mechanical   object)   and   the   digital   oscilloscope.    The   dynamic   force   transducer   (DFT)   has   an   arm   that   extends   outward   and   attaches   directly   to   the   spring.    When   a   force   is   exerted   on   the   arm,   such   as   the   force   from   a   spring,   the   DFT   generates   a   voltage   that   is   directly   proportional   to   the   applied   force.
DFT   Operation
●   The   side   of the   DFT   has   two   knobs:
–      Sensitivity   should   always   be   turned   to   its   maximum   value   (clockwise).
–    Zero      Adjust      allows   the   output   voltage   to   be   shifted   to   0   V   when   a   force   is   applied   to   the   arm.   This   is   akin   to   the   ”tare”   setting   on   a   digital   scale.
●   If you do not see   a signal   from   the   DFT,   make   sure   the   device   is   switched   to   ON.   If this   does   not   work,   your   TA   can   check   the   battery.
Oscilloscope   OperationThe      oscilloscope      has    a      myriad      of   settings    and      features,    but    you      will      only      need      to    change    a      few      things   throughout the experiment.    Changing any settings on the   device   only   efects   what   is   observed   on   the   screen,   nothing   about   the   input   signal   changes.   
Figure   8:      The   oscilloscope   control   panel   with   the   relevant   controls   circled.
Oscilloscope   Setup      Adjustments
●   A   BNC   cable   connects   the   DFT   to   the   oscilloscope.      Ensure   the   the   cable   is   attached   to   channel   A.   ●      .
●   Ensure   that   the   VAR   knob   is   pointed   at   ”CAL”   and   left   alone.
●   Turn   on   the   oscilloscope   with   the   green   ”POWER”   button.
●   Press   the   ”      .”
●   Press   the   ”DIGITAL   MEMORY”   button   (circled   in   green).
●   Use the ”TB” control   (circled in   cyan)   to   adjust   the   time   base.    This is   the   scale   for   the   horizontal   axis   which corresponds to time.    The time on the   display   indicates   the   amount   of time   corresponding   to   the
1   cm   grid   on   the   output   screen.   Adjust   this   setting   to   ”0.5   s.”
●   The   voltage   scale   operates   in   the   same   way,   but   the   changes   are   to   the   vertical   axis.      To   adjust   the      voltage   scale,   use   the   leftmost   control   circled   in   red,   labeled   as   ”A   V –   mV.”   Set   the   value   to   ”0.1   V.”
●   Note:      you   are encouraged to play with the   time   and   voltage   scales,   choosing   values   which   give   the   best   presentation   on   the   output   screen.
●   The   ”XMAGN”   button   is   the   rightmost   button   circled   in   green.    Press   this   button   until   the   display   shows   [-   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -]   so   the   device   continuously   collects   new   data.    This   may   change   the   TB   setting.
Readjust   to   the   value   to   ”0.4   s.”
●   Press   ”GND”   (circled   in   red) to   ground the   input,   setting   it to   0   V.   Turn   the   ”X-POS”   and   ”Y-POS”   knobs to center the output line on the screen.    Do not touch these knobs   for the   rest   of the experiment.      This   ensures   consistency   of values   on   the   output   screen.
●   Press ”GND”   again so the signal   from   the   DFT   is   displayed   on   the   output   screen.    As the   force   applied   to   the   DFT   changes,   the   signal   on   the   screen   will   move   up   or   down.         If   the   line   moves   beyond   the   output   screen,   adjust   the   DFT   ”Zero   Adjust”   knob.   
Figure   9
Oscilloscope   MeasurementsThe   oscilloscope   has   horizontal   and   vertical   cursors   (lines)   that   allow   for   measurements   of voltage   and   time   intervals.       The   cursors      are   setup      and   moved   using   the   ”soft-keys”   which      are   shown   in   the   Figure   9      (the   surface   of the   buttons   point   toward   the   ceiling).Inspect   the   main   screen.    If there   is   no   text   at   the   bottom   of the   screen,   press   one   of the   blue   soft-keys   below   the   screen   to   make   the   text   appear.      If one   of the   soft-keys   has   ”RETURN”   displayed   above   it,   keep   pressing   it   until   it   no   longer   says   ”RETURN”   to   get   back   to   the   top   menu.   You   should   see:
CURSORS                SETTINGS                     TEXT   OFF
●   To   display   the   measurement   cursors,      ﬁrst   press   the   ”MODE”   soft-key.         Toggle   ”V-CURS”   and   ”T-   CURS”   to   show   or   hide   the   lines.      The   press   ”RETURN”   to   move   to   the   previous   options.
●   In   order   to   measure   time   intervals,   you   will   use   the   T-cursors   which   display   as   two   vertical   lines.      The   horizontal   distance   between   the   two   lines   corresponds   to   an   amount   of time,   which   is   displayed   on   the   top   of the   screen.
●   Use   the   soft-keys   to   move   the   two   lines   to   the   left   or   right.    These   cursors   allow   you   to   measure   the   period   of oscillation.      By   aligning   the   cursors   to   adjacent   peaks,   the   period   can   be   determined.
●   Instead   of determining the   frequency   using the value   displayed   on the   screen,   calculate   the   value   using   f   =   1/T.      This   will   be   more   accurate   than   using   the   displayed   value.
3          Static   Measurement   of the   Spring   ConstantThe   ﬁrst   set   of   measurements   will   be   made   without   the   electronic   devices.    The   multipart   theory   question   was written to help you prepare   for   this   experiment.    Your goal   is   to   use   Hooke’s   law   to   determine   the   spring   constant,      k,      by   making      a   series   of   measurements   with   the   weight   stationary.         The   spring   will   stretch   by   diferent   amounts   depending   on   the   suspended   mass.    The   displacements   can   be   measured   directly   with   a   ruler   or   meter   stick.
1.    (1 pt) Write an equation that   relates   the   mass,   spring   constant,   and   displacement   (this   was   the   subject   of the   ﬁrst   set   of theory   questions).
2.    (1   pt)   Does   the   spring   constant   depend   on   the   mass   suspended   by   the   spring?
3.    (3   pt)   Describe   the   method   you   will   use   to   make   your   measurements   and   analyze   the   results.    Be   sure   to   include   the   dependent   and   independent   variables   in   your   experiment.    Think   about   a   plot   you   can   make   to   determine   the   value   of   k   from   your   measurements   of mass   and   displacement.
4.    Organize a table and make   your   measurements.    The mass   of the   spring   can   be   neglected,   but   the   hook   must   be   included   in   all   measurements   of mass.
5.    (3   pt)   Generate   a   plot   of your   data   using curve.ﬁt   and   determine   k ±   δk.   There   are   multiple ways this   can   be   done.    You   are   free   to   choose   a   method.    Be   sure   to   include   horizontal   and   vertical   error   bars   corresponding   to   measurement   uncertainties.    Show   your   error   bar   calculations.
6.    (1 pt) Predict the undamped angular frequencies, ω0   , using your determined value of   k for each diferent   mass.
